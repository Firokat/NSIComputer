# NSIComputer

## Explaination

This website is the result of a homework I've to do during the Oct hollydays of 2020 in computing class.

It's a website that show the main parts of a PC. I had to do the motherboard page but I also done the index page for fun, the other parts were made by class mates so it wont be on this repo.

PS : The website is in french

The site is hosted with Github Pages at [here](https://firokat.github.io/NSIComputer)
